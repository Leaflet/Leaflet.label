Leaflet.label
=============

Leaflet.label is a plugin for adding labels to markers &amp; shapes on leaflet powered maps.

Check out the [demo](http://leaflet.github.com/Leaflet.label/).

##Usage examples

If you want to just bind a label to a marker that will show when the mouse is over it, it's really easy:

````
L.marker([-37.7772, 175.2606]).bindLabel('Look revealing label!').addTo(map);
````

Path overlays work the same:

````
L.polyline([
	[-37.7612, 175.2756],
	[-37.7702, 175.2796],
	[-37.7802, 175.2750],
]).bindLabel('Even polylines can have labels.').addTo(map)	
````

If you would prefer the label to be always visible set the ````noHide: true```` option and call ````showLabel()```` once added to the map:

````
L.marker([-37.785, 175.263])
	.bindLabel('A sweet static label!', { noHide: true })
	.addTo(map)
	.showLabel();
````

*N.B.* if you call `showLabel()` before it is added to the map the label will not show.

##Options

When you call ````bindLabel()```` you can pass in an options object. These options are:

 - **noHide**: doesn't attach event handler for showing/hiding the label on mouseover/out.
 - **className**: the css class to add to the label element
 - **flip**: the label's orientation; can be 'right' (the default), 'left', or 'auto'. 'auto' puts the label to the left on the right half of the map, to the right on the left half.

##Positioning the label for custom icons

The label is positioned relative to the L.Icon's ````iconAnchor```` option. To reposition the label set the ````labelAnchor```` option of your icon. By default ````labelAnchor```` is set so the label will show vertically centered for the default icon (````L.Icon.Default````).

E.g. Vertically center an icon with ````iconAnchor```` set as the center of the icon:

````
var myIcon = L.icon({
	iconUrl: 'my-icon.png',
	iconSize: [20, 20],
	iconAnchor: [10, 10],
	labelAnchor: [6, 0] // as I want the label to appear 2px past the icon (10 + 2 - 6)
});
L.marker([-37.7772, 175.2606], {
	icon: myIcon
}).bindLabel('Look revealing label!').addTo(map);
````

When positioning the label L.Label includes a 6px horizontal padding. you will need to take this into account when setting ````labelAnchor````.

##Alternative label plugin

My previous label plugin is still available at https://github.com/jacobtoye/Leaflet.iconlabel. This plugin is a little harder to use, however if you want to have both the icon and label bound to the same event this plugin is for you.
